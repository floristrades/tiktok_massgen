A tiktok mass-editor for CapCut generating as many as requested videos using editing profiles that the user can pre-set themselves written in Python.

Currently has a client-side GUI to setup various profile and manage settings.

Features:
- Can execute nearly every capcut function, filter and much more.
- Built in youtube>mp3 converter that sorts based on genre classes to assist in audio choosing during the video creation.
- Managing hashtags, store a hashtag list under each profile for faster posting
- Supports CapCut PRO features

Features to add in the near future:
- Full customizable parent class, child class populator with support to easily map these functions to the program.
- Integrate license key support.
- Make a trial version that has 2 free videos locked to the HWID.
- Make a limited version that's capped in how many videos or minutes worth of videos can be generated based on the license key.
- Audio normalization to handle rare edge cases of audio being naturally louder or quieter than it's peers.
- Remodel & restyle the GUI to fit a custom theme.
- Map every button / function capcut has to offer to support every action (near every).

Possible features:
- Create support for other video editors like Sony vegas, After effects.
- Could create a light version that's aimed at extreme speed that works without relying on CapCut.
- Integrate MidJourney without an API to fetch/generate images relevant to whatever frame is requested.
- Add word automatic word highlighting based on the relevance of the word, context has to be defined further.
- Server-side support as CapCut doesn't render client-side so a server without a powerful GPU is viable.
- Multi-threading with either a sandbox type approach or containization.
